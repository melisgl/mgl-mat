  If it's :PINNED (only supported if PINNING-SUPPORTED-P), then no
  separate storage is allocated for the foreign array. Instead, it
  aliases the lisp array (via the BACKING-ARRAY facet).

  If it's :STATIC, then the lisp backing arrays are allocated
  statically via the static-vectors library. On some implementations,
  explicit freeing of static vectors is necessary, this is taken care
  of by finalizers or can be controlled with WITH-FACET-BARRIER.
  DESTROY-CUBE and DESTROY-FACET may also be of help.

  :CUDA-HOST is the same as :STATIC, but any copies to/from the
  GPU (i.e. the [CUDA-ARRAY][facet-name] facet) will be done via the
  [CUDA-HOST-ARRAY][facet-name] facet whose memory pages will also be
  locked and registered with `cuMemHostRegister` which allows quicker
  and asynchronous copying to and from CUDA land.

  The default is :PINNED if available, because it's the most
  efficient. If pinning is not available, then it's :STATIC.")
