  "This is the library on which \\MGL-MAT (see MGL-MAT::@MAT-MANUAL)
  is built. The idea of automatically translating between various
  representations may be useful for other applications, so this got
  its own package and all ties to \\MGL-MAT has been severed.

  This package defines CUBE, an abstract base class that provides a
  framework for automatic conversion between various representations
  of the same data. To define a cube, CUBE needs to be subclassed and
  the @CUBE-FACET-EXTENSION-API be implemented.

  If you are only interested in how to use cubes in general, read
  @CUBE-BASICS, @CUBE-LIFETIME and @CUBE-FACET-BARRIER.

  If you want to implement a new cube datatype, then see @CUBE-FACETS,
  @CUBE-FACET-EXTENSION-API, and @CUBE-DEFAULT-CALL-WITH-FACET*.")
