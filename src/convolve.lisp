  else B is assumed to be 1. The rest of the dimensions encode the
  input (X) and output (Y) N dimensional feature maps. START, STRIDE
  and ANCHOR are lists of length N. START is the multi-dimensional
  index of the first element of the input feature map (for each
  element in the batch) for which the convolution must be computed.
  Then (ELT STRIDE (- N 1)) is added to the last element of START and
  so on until (ARRAY-DIMENSION X 1) is reached. Then the last element
  of START is reset, (ELT STRIDE (- N 2)) is added to the first but
  last element of START and we scan the last dimension again. Take a
  2d example, START is (0 0), STRIDE is (1 2), and X is a B*2x7
  matrix.

  W is:

      1 2 1
      2 4 2
      1 2 1

  and ANCHOR is (1 1) which refers to the element of W whose value is
  4. This anchor point of W is placed over elements of X whose multi
  dimensional index is in numbers in this figure (only one element in
  the batch is shown):

      0,0 . 0,2 . 0,4 . 0,6
      1,0 . 1,2 . 1,4 . 1,6

  When applying W at position P of X, the convolution is the sum of
  the products of overlapping elements of X and W when W's ANCHOR is
  placed at P. Elements of W over the edges of X are multiplied with 0
  so are effectively ignored. The order of application of W to
  positions defined by START, STRIDE and ANCHOR is undefined.

  Y must be a B*2x4 (or 2x4 if not BATCHED) matrix in this example,
  just large enough to hold the results of the convolutions."
