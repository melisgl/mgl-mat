(defsection @mat-what-is-it (:title "What's MGL-MAT?")
  "\\MGL-MAT is library for working with multi-dimensional arrays
  which supports efficient interfacing to foreign and CUDA code with
  automatic translations between cuda, foreign and lisp storage. BLAS
  and CUBLAS bindings are available.")

(defsection @mat-what-kind-of-matrices
    (:title "What kind of matrices are supported?")
  "Currently only row-major single and double float matrices are
  supported, but it would be easy to add single and double precision
  complex types too. Other numeric types, such as byte and native
  integer, can be added too, but they are not supported by CUBLAS.
  There are no restrictions on the number of dimensions, and reshaping
  is possible. All functions operate on the visible portion of the
  matrix (which is subject to displacement and shaping), invisible
  elements are not affected.")

(defsection @mat-installation (:title "Where to Get it?")
  "All dependencies are in quicklisp except for
  [CL-CUDA](https://github.com/takagi/cl-cuda) that needs to be
  fetched from github. Just clone \\CL-CUDA and \\MGL-MAT into
  `quicklisp/local-projects/` and you are set. \\MGL-MAT itself lives
  [at github](https://github.com/melisgl/mgl-mat), too.

  "We are going to see how to create matrices, access their contents.

  Creating matrices is just like creating lisp arrays:

  ```commonlisp
  (make-mat '6)
  ==> #<MAT 6 A #(0.0d0 0.0d0 0.0d0 0.0d0 0.0d0 0.0d0)>

  (make-mat '(2 3) :ctype :float :initial-contents '((1 2 3) (4 5 6)))
  ==> #<MAT 2x3 AB #2A((1.0 2.0 3.0) (4.0 5.0 6.0))>

  (make-mat '(2 3 4) :initial-element 1)
  ==> #<MAT 2x3x4 A #3A(((1.0d0 1.0d0 1.0d0 1.0d0)
  -->                    (1.0d0 1.0d0 1.0d0 1.0d0)
  -->                    (1.0d0 1.0d0 1.0d0 1.0d0))
  -->                   ((1.0d0 1.0d0 1.0d0 1.0d0)
  -->                    (1.0d0 1.0d0 1.0d0 1.0d0)
  -->                    (1.0d0 1.0d0 1.0d0 1.0d0)))>
  ```

  The most prominent difference from lisp arrays is that `MAT`s are
  always numeric and their element type (called CTYPE here) defaults
  to :DOUBLE.

  Individual elements can be accessed or set with MREF:

  ```commonlisp
  (let ((m (make-mat '(2 3))))
    (setf (mref m 0 0) 1)
    (setf (mref m 0 1) (* 2 (mref m 0 0)))
    (incf (mref m 0 2) 4)
    m)
  ==> #<MAT 2x3 AB #2A((1.0d0 2.0d0 4.0d0) (0.0d0 0.0d0 0.0d0))>
  ```

  Compared to AREF MREF is a very expensive operation and it's best
  used sparingly. Instead, typical code relies much more on matrix
  level operations:

  ```commonlisp
  (princ (scal! 2 (fill! 3 (make-mat 4))))
  .. #<MAT 4 BF #(6.0d0 6.0d0 6.0d0 6.0d0)>
  ==> #<MAT 4 ABF #(6.0d0 6.0d0 6.0d0 6.0d0)>
  ```

  The content of a matrix can be accessed in various representations
  called _facets_. \\MGL-MAT takes care of synchronizing these facets
  by copying data around lazily, but doing its best to share storage
  for facets that allow it.

  Notice the `ABF` in the printed results. It illustrates that behind
  the scenes FILL! worked on the [BACKING-ARRAY][facet-name]
  facet (hence the `B`) that's basically a 1d lisp array. SCAL! on the
  other hand made a foreign call to the BLAS `dscal` function for
  which it needed the [FOREIGN-ARRAY][facet-name] facet (`F`).
  Finally, the `A` stands for the [ARRAY][facet-name] facet that was
  created when the array was printed. All facets are up-to-date (else
  some of the characters would be lowercase). This is possible because
  these three facets actually share storage which is never the case
  for the [CUDA-ARRAY][facet-name] facet. Now if we have a
  CUDA-capable GPU, CUDA can be enabled with WITH-CUDA*:

  ```commonlisp
  (with-cuda* ()
    (princ (scal! 2 (fill! 3 (make-mat 4)))))
  .. #<MAT 4 C #(6.0d0 6.0d0 6.0d0 6.0d0)>
  ==> #<MAT 4 A #(6.0d0 6.0d0 6.0d0 6.0d0)>
  ```

  Note the lonely `C` showing that only the [CUDA-ARRAY][facet-name]
  facet was used for both FILL! and SCAL!. When WITH-CUDA* exits and
  destroys the CUDA context, it destroys all CUDA facets, moving their
  data to the [ARRAY][facet-name] facet, so the returned MAT only has
  that facet.

  When there is no high-level operation that does what we want, we may
  need to add new operations. This is usually best accomplished by
  accessing one of the facets directly, as in the following example:"
  (log-det-example (include (:start (logdet function)
                                    :end (end-of-logdet-example variable))
                            :header-nl "```commonlisp"
                            :footer-nl "```"))
  "Notice that LOGDET doesn't know about CUDA at all. WITH-FACETS
  gives it the content of the matrix as a normal multidimensional lisp
  array, copying the data from the GPU or elsewhere if necessary. This
  allows new representations (`FACET`s) to be added easily and it also
  avoids copying if the facet is already up-to-date. Of course, adding
  CUDA support to LOGDET could make it more efficient.

  Adding support for matrices that, for instance, live on a remote
  machine is thus possible with a new facet type and existing code
  would continue to work (albeit possibly slowly). Then one could
  optimize the bottleneck operations by sending commands over the
  network instead of copying data.

  It is a bad idea to conflate resource management policy and
  algorithms. \\MGL-MAT does its best to keep them separate.")

(defsection @mat-shaping (:title "Shaping")
  "We are going to discuss various ways to change the visible portion
  and dimensions of matrices. Conceptually a matrix has an _underlying
  non-displaced storage vector_. For `(MAKE-MAT 10 :DISPLACEMENT
  7 :MAX-SIZE 21)` this underlying vector looks like this:

      displacement | visible elements  | slack
      . . . . . . . 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 . . . .

  Whenever a matrix is reshaped (or _displaced to_ in lisp
  terminology), its displacement and dimensions change but the
  underlying vector does not.

  The rules for accessing displaced matrices is the same as always:
  multiple readers can run in parallel, but attempts to write will
  result in an error if there are either readers or writers on any of
  the matrices that share the same underlying vector."
  (@mat-shaping-comparison-to-lisp section)
  (@mat-shaping-functional section)
  (@mat-shaping-destructive section))

(defsection @mat-shaping-comparison-to-lisp (:title "Comparison to Lisp Arrays")
  "One way to reshape and displace MAT objects is with MAKE-MAT and
  its DISPLACED-TO argument whose semantics are similar to that of
  MAKE-ARRAY in that the displacement is _relative_ to the
  displacement of DISPLACED-TO.

  ```commonlisp
  (let* ((base (make-mat 10 :initial-element 5 :displacement 1))
         (mat (make-mat 6 :displaced-to base :displacement 2)))
    (fill! 1 mat)
    (values base mat))
  ==> #<MAT 1+10+0 A #(5.0d0 5.0d0 1.0d0 1.0d0 1.0d0 1.0d0 1.0d0 1.0d0 5.0d0
  -->                  5.0d0)>
  ==> #<MAT 3+6+2 AB #(1.0d0 1.0d0 1.0d0 1.0d0 1.0d0 1.0d0)>
  ```

  There are important semantic differences compared to lisp arrays all
  which follow from the fact that displacement operates on the
  underlying conceptual non-displaced vector.

  - Matrices can be displaced and have slack even without DISPLACED-TO
    just like `BASE` in the above example.

  - It's legal to alias invisible elements of DISPLACED-TO as long as
    the new matrix fits into the underlying storage.

  - Negative displacements are allowed with DISPLACED-TO as long as
    the adjusted displacement is non-negative.

  - Further shaping operations can make invisible portions of the
    DISPLACED-TO matrix visible by changing the displacement.

  - In contrast to ARRAY-DISPLACEMENT, MAT-DISPLACEMENT only returns
    an offset into the underlying storage vector.")

  "The largest class of bugs has to do with synchronization of facets

  mispecifies the DIRECTION argument of WITH-FACET. For example, the
  matrix argument of SCAL! should be accessed with direciton :IO. But
  if it's :INPUT instead, then subsequent access to the ARRAY facet
  will not see the changes made by AXPY!, and if it's :OUTPUT, then
  any changes made to the ARRAY facet since the last update of the
  CUDA-ARRAY facet will not be copied and from the wrong input SCAL!
  will compute the wrong result.

  Using the SLIME inspector or trying to access the

  which the corresponding CUDA context was initialized will fail. For

(defsection @mat-facets (:title "Facets")
  "A MAT is a CUBE (see MGL-CUBE::@CUBE-MANUAL) whose facets are
  different representations of numeric arrays. These facets can be
  accessed with WITH-FACETS with one of the following
  [FACET-NAME][locative] locatives:"
  (backing-array facet-name)
  (array facet-name)
  (foreign-array facet-name)
  (cuda-host-array facet-name)
  (cuda-array facet-name)
  "Facets bound by with WITH-FACETS are to be treated as dynamic
  extent: it is not allowed to keep a reference to them beyond the
  dynamic scope of WITH-FACETS.

  For example, to implement the FILL! operation using only the
  BACKING-ARRAY, one could do this:

  ```commonlisp
  (let ((displacement (mat-displacement x))
        (size (mat-size x)))
   (with-facets ((x* (x 'backing-array :direction :output)))
     (fill x* 1 :start displacement :end (+ displacement size))))
  ```
 
  DIRECTION is :OUTPUT because we clobber all values in `X`. Armed
  with this knowledge about the direction, WITH-FACETS will not copy
  data from another facet if the backing array is not up-to-date.

  To transpose a 2d matrix with the [ARRAY][facet-name] facet:

  ```commonlisp
  (destructuring-bind (n-rows n-columns) (mat-dimensions x)
    (with-facets ((x* (x 'array :direction :io)))
      (dotimes (row n-rows)
        (dotimes (column n-columns)
          (setf (aref x* row column) (aref x* column row))))))
  ```

  Note that DIRECTION is :IO, because we need the data in this facet
  to be up-to-date (that's the input part) and we are invalidating all
  other facets by changing values (that's the output part).

  To sum the values of a matrix using the [FOREIGN-ARRAY][facet-name]
  facet:

  ```commonlisp
  (let ((sum 0))
    (with-facets ((x* (x 'foreign-array :direction :input)))
      (let ((pointer (offset-pointer x*)))
        (loop for index below (mat-size x)
              do (incf sum (cffi:mem-aref pointer (mat-ctype x) index)))))
    sum)
  ```

  See DIRECTION for a complete description of :INPUT, :OUTPUT and :IO.
  For MAT objects, that needs to be refined. If a MAT is reshaped
  and/or displaced in a way that not all elements are visible then
  those elements are always kept intact and copied around. This is
  accomplished by turning :OUTPUT into :IO automatically on such MATs.

  We have finished our introduction to the various facets. It must be
  said though that one can do anything without ever accessing a facet
  directly or even being aware of them as most operations on `MAT`s
  take care of choosing the most appropriate facet behind the scenes.
  In particular, most operations automatically use CUDA, if available
  and initialized. See WITH-CUDA* for detail.")
